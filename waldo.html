<p>Welcome to Where's Waldo, a game about spotting Waldo in as few guesses as possible!</p>
<p>Upload an image file that includes Waldo hidden somewhere within it. If Waldo is not found, the game will default to an image that we have.</p>
<p>The game will then locate Waldo and, based on where you click, tell you how far away you are!</p>

<!-- This is where it calls process.php when you submit the file -->
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="process.php" method="POST">
    <p>Upload your image file including Waldo:</p>
    <input type="file" name="test-cases" /><br />
    <input type="submit" value="Upload" name="submit" />
</form>
