<p>Have you ever played Where's Waldo and been convinced that maybe, just this once, the author had forgot to draw Waldo in?</p>
<p>Well look no further! This project will search an image for you with opencv2 and tell you whether or not Waldo is present.</p>
<p>Upload an image below to get started!</p>

<!-- This is where it calls process.php when you submit the file -->
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="process.php" method="POST">
    <p>Upload your image file including Waldo:</p>
    <input type="file" name="test-cases" /><br />
    <input type="submit" value="Upload" name="submit"/>
</form>
